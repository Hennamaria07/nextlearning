Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that is built on top of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is designed to make it easier to create server-rendered React applications with a focus on developer productivity, performance, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Next.js provides a set of tools and conventions that simplify various aspects of building web applications.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features
<ol>
<li>Server-side rendering (SSR): Next.js allows you to render React components on the server side before sending them to the client. This can improve page load times and SEO, as search engines can easily index the content.
</li>
<li>Static site generation (SSG): Next.js also supports static site generation, where you can pre-render pages at build time. This approach is great for content- heavy websites and can offer even better performance and SEO benefits.
</li>
<li>API routes: It offers a built-in API route feature that allows you to create serverless API endpoints within your Next.js project, making it easy to handle backend logic.</li>
</ol>

## Routing
Routing is like giving directions to a website. When you type a web address (URL) into your browser, routing tells the website which page or thing to show you. It's like a map that guides the website to the right place when you click a link or enter a web address. So, routing helps the website know what to display based on what you're looking for.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
